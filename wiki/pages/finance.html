    {{ subheading('Process of Securing Sponsorships for IGEM Toronto') }}
    <div>
        <p>At IGEM Toronto 2024, we embarked on a structured approach to secure sponsorships, ensuring that our project goals aligned with the values and priorities of potential sponsors. Here’s how we accomplished this:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-container" style="position: relative; display: inline-block; max-width: 200%;">
        <!-- Image -->
        <img src="{{ new_cdn('finance-asset/timeline.png')}}" style="width: 2000px !important; height: auto !important; ">
    
        <!-- Phase 1 Button positioned inside the image -->
        <div style="position: absolute; top: 20%; left: 70%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%);">
            <button onclick="extendItem('more-info-identify')" style=" padding: 10px 20px; background-color: #5C2BD5; color: white; width: 300px; border: none; cursor: pointer;">
                More Info
            </button>
            <div class="content" id="more-info-identify">
                <p>We began by researching and identifying companies, organizations, and institutions whose mission and vision aligned with the focus of this year’s IGEM project. This alignment helped demonstrate to sponsors how their support could contribute meaningfully to advancing research in our field.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Phase 2 Button positioned inside the image -->
        <div style="position: absolute; top: 41.25%; left: 70%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%);">
            <button onclick="extendItem('more-info-contact')" style=" padding: 10px 20px; background-color: #5C2BD5; color: white; border: none; width: 300px; cursor: pointer;">
                More Info
            </button>
            <div class="content" id="more-info-contact">
                <p>Once a list of potential sponsors was identified, we reached out through emails, presentations, and meetings. We crafted personalized communications that highlighted the mutual benefits of collaboration, ensuring sponsors understood the impact their contribution would have on our project.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Phase 3 Button positioned inside the image -->
        <div style="position: absolute; top: 63.6%; left: 70%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%);">
            <button onclick="extendItem('more-info-negotiate')" style=" padding: 10px 20px; background-color: #5C2BD5; color: white; width: 300px; border: none; cursor: pointer;">
                More Info
            </button>
            <div class="content" id="more-info-negotiate">
                <p>Our sponsorship model was structured into various tiers based on contribution levels, with each tier offering different levels of visibility and involvement. Sponsors who committed larger amounts received greater benefits, such as logo placement, public acknowledgment, and invitations to exclusive project events. This tiered system helped facilitate productive negotiations and offered flexibility to sponsors.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Phase 4 Button positioned inside the image -->
        <div style="position: absolute; top: 90.5%; left: 70%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%);">
            <button onclick="extendItem('more-info-allocate')" style=" padding: 10px 20px; background-color: #5C2BD5; color: white; width: 300px; border: none; cursor: pointer;">
                More Info
            </button>
            <div class="content" id="more-info-allocate">
                <p>The funds we secured were crucial to advancing our experiments and research. Sponsorship contributions were strategically allocated to cover material costs, equipment, and lab resources, ensuring that we had the support necessary to push our project forward.</p>
