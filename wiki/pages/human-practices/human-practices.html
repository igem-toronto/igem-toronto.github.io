    Antibiotic Resistance has slowly risen to become one of the biggest health crises of our time, resulting in numerous deaths annually and threatening the advances in modern medicine [1]. However, this issue extends beyond medical consequences, affecting global development and undermining Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs) ; it also further exacerbates gender disparity and poverty. Antibiotic resistance is not merely a clinical challenge but also reflects systemic failure in healthcare, socioeconomic disparities and inadequate government [1].
  </p>
  <p>

    Addressing this multifaceted issue requires a solution that goes beyond conventional methods. In response to the issue Plasmid AI represents a reimagining of tackling antibiotic resistance. We are using AI to create resistance nullifying plasmids that can be transferred to healthy bacteria. This approach not only targets individual strains but is adaptable along a spectrum of resistance mechanisms, providing a more flexible solution to addressing antibiotic resistance.

  <p>
    Central to our approach is the understanding that scientific innovation thrives when there is a people centered approach. Our Human Practices journey emphasizes that scientific innovation cannot thrive without the voices of the communities we aim to serve. We have engaged with and incorporated feedback from diverse stakeholders to ensure that our project has a holistic perspective and our solution resonates with real life experiences and needs. This year our community engagement project AImersion has allowed us to understand the cultural contexts that surround community perspectives, allowing us to design interventions that are impactful and informed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Building on last year’s efforts, our team has taken a more streamlined approach to inclusivity. We have focused on understanding whether our project has a direct impact on the vulnerable communities we aim to engage with, in order to avoid exploitation and ensure there is a meaningful exchange.
  </p>

  <p>
    We acknowledge the rapid evolution of AI and its role in our project, to responsibly harness this new technology we have developed a tailored framework incorporating elements from three existing models. Our approach emphasizes ethical AI usage, transparency, incorporating community engagement and a comprehensive risk assessment to ensure safety and transparency. By doing so we aim to set a standard for AI stewardship that aligns with technological advancements while being safe, ethical and community centered.

  </p>
  <p>
    In light of the current ecological crisis, we have conducted a thorough impact analysis, tracking our carbon footprint. In collaboration with a compliance officer from the Ministry of Environment we have developed a future plan to reduce our carbon footprint if our project is scaled up. This strategy ensures our project addresses antibiotic resistance while being sustainable.

  </p>
  <p>
    We understand the importance of inspiring individuals through synthetic biology. This year, we hosted a seminar for incoming freshmen to educate them about our project and the potential of synthetic biology. To foster communication we held a debate exploring the ethical side of our project. We also gathered feedback from our educational events to identify areas for improvement. Additionally our partnership with the Canadian Association for Girls in Science. Allowed us to host three engaging synbio workshops for ages 6-17, helping spark their interest in synthetic biology.

<div>
  <p>
      Our stakeholder framework was designed to ensure that there is a safe space for opinions to be voiced. We recognize that even if certain modifications might be challenging to implement, our goal is to find a middle ground that balances stakeholder satisfaction with feasibility. <BR>
    To achieve this, we designed a five part approach:<BR>
  </p>

</div>

  {{subsubheading('1. Identification of Key Stakeholders')}}
<div>

  <p> Our first step in stakeholder engagement was to adopt a holistic approach by mapping stakeholders into specific sectors. This process helped ensure that we consider diverse viewpoints essential for the success of our project. We identified the following sectors</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Engaging with healthcare professionals to understand the implications of antibiotic resistance is a healthcare setting </li>
    <lk> <strong>History : </strong> Reaching out to Historians to gather insights on how medical innovations throughout history have influenced public perceptions of healthcare inventions. Our aim was to understand how past advancements, along with colonial legacies and historical inequalities, shape contemporary attitudes towards medical inventions today specifically in the context of synthetic biology. </lk>
    <li><strong>Biosecurity:</strong>Consulting with biosecurity experts to address safety and regulatory considerations of our project such as the potential for dual use.</li>
    <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong>Connecting with community members to gather diverse perspectives of AI integration into synthetic biology. We aim to promote inclusivity by understanding different viewpoints and we have encouraged individuals to also share their stories that led to this view point to explore the cultural contexts that shape these perspectives. This approach helps us create a more holistic understanding of community values and concerns related to our project
</li>
    <li><strong>Indigenous Communities:</strong>While we intended to engage with Indigenous communities to understand their perspectives on  AI in healthcare and antibiotic resistance, we faced challenges in connecting with relevant organizations. Despite these hurdles, we acknowledge the importance of engaging with vulnerable communities. We have done a preliminary impact assessment to identify the connection between our project and health concerns of Indigenous populations. Moving forward, we remain committed to continuing our efforts to contact and collaborate with Indigenous communities.
</li>
    <li><strong>Environmental Sector:</strong>  Reaching out to environmental experts to assess the ecological impacts of our project and how we can reduce our carbon footprint if our project were to scale up, to ensure that our project is sustainable and eco-friendly.


</li>
    <li><strong>Bioethics: </strong> Engaging with bioethicists to ensure the safety of our project, to navigate the moral implications of our project ensuring our approach is respectful and moral.</li>

    <li><strong>Academia: </strong> Contacting academic researchers specializing in antibiotic resistances and related fields to enhance our scientific approach. This helped ground our project in rigorous research.</li>
    
    
  </ul>
  </div>
  {{subsubheading('2. Impact Assessment')}}
<div>
  <ul>
    Our next step was conducting an impact assessment focused on Indigenous communities. In Canada the past continues to shape the present in profound ways. Historical trauma- including mistreatment, forced family separation, land dispossession and cultural suppression - has had lasting effects on the physical and mental health of Indigenous populations  [2]. These intergenerational harms have been widely documented and emphasize the need for approaches that are grounded in respect and understanding.

With this in mind, we conducted an impact assessment focused on ensuring our project impacts Indigenous communities before initiating outreach. Our assessment involved reviewing recent scholarly articles to identify how antibiotic resistance impacts Indigenous populations.  Our goal was to foster respectful informed partnerships without perpetuating harm or exploitation.

  </ul>
  </div>

    {{subsubheading('3. Stakeholder Engagement')}}
<div>
  <ul>
    Two way communication with diverse stakeholders has been central to our project. Initially we reached out to professionals through perceptual questions to understand their personal perspectives, we followed up with questions to gather insights from their respective fields as well. This helped us identify critical areas that needed attention in our project

For community engagement, we launched the AImerion project, which allowed community members to express their perspectives through art and storytelling. This created an interactive platform where communities can express their perspectives in a safe space.
These initiatives have helped us ensure that our stakeholders have been co-creators in shaping our solution.

  </ul>
  </div>

     {{subsubheading('4. Feedback Integration')}}
 <div>
  <ul>
    We designed our feedback integration process to ensure that stakeholder input directly informs and shapes our project. By collecting feedback through various channels such as art, interviews and feedback forms we aimed to capture diverse perspectives and concerns. Analyzing this feedback has helped us to identify key themes and insights which we have incorporated into different aspects of Plasmid AI.
  </ul>
   </div>

  {{subsubheading('5. Continuous Monitoring')}}  
<div>

  <ul>
    Continuous Monitoring is essential to our approach, allowing us to assess the impact of our initiative and allowing open lines of communication with stakeholders. We have scheduled follow-up meetings in October to share how we have integrated the feedback we received During these meetings we will ask our stakeholders if they are satisfied with the integration and discuss any additional concerts or suggestions they may have. This ongoing dialogue ensures that our project remains responsive to community needs and fosters a collaborative environment.
  </ul>
